The PTS format consists of a .zip file with two folders CSV and META.  The 
example file is called weather-pts.zip in the repository.

In the CSV folder are .csv files.  The files can be named anything, but it's 
helpful to name them according to a data point and a time series in the 
data point.  For the weather data, they are called city#_data#.csv, where 
city# is the number of the city and data# is the number of the time 
series associated with that city.  For example, city1 might be San 
Francisco, and data2 might be mean temperatures, so city1_data2.csv 
would contain a time series for mean temperatures for San Francisco.

The .csv files each have four columns, with the header SampleNum,Raw,X,Y.  
The only important columns are X and Y.  X gives the time points for a 
time series and Y gives the values for the time series.  For the weather 
data, SampleNum goes from 1 ... number of time points and for Raw it is Y.

For each .csv file in the CSV folder, there is an associated .ini file in 
the META folder.  The two files should have the same name (except for the 
extension).  The .ini files contain meta data which describes the data 
point itself (i.e. the city for the weather data), and the time series in 
the .csv file.  The .ini files can have comment lines starting with ";".  
Each .ini file has three sections, denoted by lines with the keywords "[test]", 
"[operation]", and "[waveform]". 

The "[test]" section contains information about the data point (city).  
This data is used to fill the metadata table in the dial-a-cluster web app.  
Each line in the test section looks like

City="New York"

Before the equals sign is the table header, and after the equals sign is 
the description (must be in quotes).  This section is the same for each 
.ini file which describes the same data point (city for weather data).

The "[operation]" section has to have one line

test_op_inst_id=#

The test_op_inst_id is a keyword and the # is replaced by the number of 
the data point (must be a unique id).  For the weather data, the id used 
is the same number as the city# in the file name.

The "[waveform]" section has metadata describing the actual time series 
data contained in the associated .csv file.  The fields here have to include:

WF_DIG_ID="1"
WF_DIG_LABEL="Max Temperature"
WF_X_UNITS="Day"
WF_Y_UNITS="F"

The WF_DIG_ID field is an identifier which has to match up for each time 
series.  For the weather data, the value used is the same number as the 
data# in the file name.  The WF_DIG_LABEL field gives the title of the 
time series, so here it is "Max Temperature".  This label is used in the
plots in the dial-a-cluster web app.  The WF_X_UNITS field are the time
units and the WF_Y_UNITS are the value for the time series.

One final note: the .zip file must contain the two folders at the root 
level, and each .csv file must have an associated .ini file.  There can't 
be extra files in the archive.  If there are, the web app will 
check and refuse to load the .zip file.  This is important when zipping
the directory on a Mac, because of the .DS_Store files.
